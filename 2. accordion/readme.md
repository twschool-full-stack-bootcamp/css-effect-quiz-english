# Accordion
![](accordion.gif)
## Requirement

- To achieve the effect shown by the accordion.gif animation, most of the html and css have been provided, all you need to do is:
  1. Understand the existing html and css code, clearly understand the role of each style
  2. Add css code to achieve animation display

## NOTE

- All the picture material is in the images folder, and the accordion.png image gives the height after the expansion.
- The CSS file (style.css) gives hints that need to be supplemented (before you write, I hope you understand the existing style)
- **Expand animation for 0.6s, fold animation for 0.3s**
- Any CSS styles that you don't know (not just CSS, most of the front-end knowledge) can be searched for in [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

## Recommended information

- [Adjacent sibling selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator)
- [transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)
