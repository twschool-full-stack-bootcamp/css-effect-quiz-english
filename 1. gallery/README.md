# gallery
## Requirement

- Implement the page shown in the gallary.pdf file. The basic html pages and css are all ready, and there is not much that you need to do.
- After understanding the html, write the code needed to complete the final effect in style.css.

## NOTE

- All the picture material is in the image folder. Currently all the html pages have been written. At this stage, only the first three pictures (overlapping on the page) are needed. After learning js, use other pictures. In conjunction with the implementation of the complete Gallery animation, there will be new assignments, so this time we will comment on the following images.
- The css file has been introduced for everyone.
- Considering that if there is no idea for a classmate who has not done anything before, here is a hint: learn the transform series style of css, I believe you will have ideas after learning.
